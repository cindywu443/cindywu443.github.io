       A candy shop is always of interest to a child, and anyone else for that matter. The white print, “The Sweet Life,” was fading on the brown banner of the storefront, but my focus was on the candy inside. The chipped white paint on the door fell onto the ground simultaneously as the bells rang signaling my arrival. An overwhelming scent of sweetness hit my nose; I don’t remember whether it was the sweet chocolates, dense fudge, or sour candies. I think I spent an hour there that day; I wanted to see what my five dollars could get. Ignoring the jars of gumballs, which I first noticed when entering the store, I went straight for the sour gummies. There was a tall turning rack full of chocolate bark in the center and oversized candies (weighing a pound) in the corner. In the center were also jars of trail mix and dried fruits that were not that interesting, at least not as much as the candy jars near the register where a nice looking woman greeted me.

       I kept coming back after that.

       Soon I realized I was there less for the candy, but more for the place itself. A place filled with people who were not mine to know but to observe. It was a simple pastime, but this activity was complex. It was like flipping through channels to find what you wanted to watch that day. The shoppers ranged from children, teachers, parents, and older people. The range was so wide because sugar was something everyone enjoys regardless of age or character. These shoppers were all unique in their own ways, good and bad. There was an old man who yelled at the worker once because of the way the dried apricots looked, which she could not do anything about. There was a classmate who had stolen a bag of egg-shaped gummies, all while making conversation with the worker. Parents and their children continuously smiled while browsing the shelves. Once, I bumped into my teacher who asked what I was doing there, which confused me. I remember making “friends” with people I would see often. The shoppers only showed up occasionally but were always looking like they belonged, even if they did not. The shop was a mutual escape from everything else outside. There were not many people coming in and out, but there were memorable ones each time.

       Condos, restaurants, and flagships were setting up shop in my little neighborhood. The old coffee shop next to the laundromat rarely opened up anymore, but the 99-cents store had been open daily competing with the new shops. The change was present and noticeable. The candy shop tried to remain constant. Even under new leadership, the cozy atmosphere never really changed and the dim lights were still somehow never dull. The warm lights and wooden shelves made me feel at home, unlike the mundane white walls and blue lighted stores marketed towards the Millennials moving in. They were not fully established stores, but more of a hangout spot for 25-year-olds who scrunched up at the scent of the trash bags in the neighborhood but lived for and loved the “trashy” aesthetic there.

       This candy shop, my treasure trove, had been a crucial installment in my life up until it wasn’t. It closed up just in time for me to move on, literally and figuratively. Moving from this neighborhood was difficult, especially when there had been newly formed attachments. The Lower East Side has always had a feeling of comfort associated with it, at least in my personal experience. Its flaw was that it was too welcoming and changes had begun to take place. Sadly, the shop was drowned out by these changes. It’s weird to walk past an empty store once filled with so many memories and happiness. Growing up, I never really left my apartment or ventured from the few blocks I knew how to navigate. I just knew where I needed to be. I was familiar with the grocery stores, the park, and the school. I did not cherish any one place, but when I did it was gone just like that.
